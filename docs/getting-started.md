# SmartPark — Getting Started

> A step-by-step guide to set up and run the SmartPark project. No prior .NET experience required.

---

## 1. Install .NET 10 SDK

Download from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0

Verify the installation:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

You should see `10.0.xxx`. If you get "command not found", restart your terminal.

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd automate_test_assignment
```

---

## 3. Build

```bash
dotnet build SmartPark.slnx
```

Expected: `Build succeeded. 0 Warning(s) 0 Error(s)`

If you see package errors, run `dotnet restore SmartPark.slnx` first.

---

## 4. Run the Console App

```bash
dotnet run --project src/SmartPark.ConsoleApp
```

The app comes pre-loaded with demo vehicles. Try:

1. **Option 3** — View Active Tickets (see what's parked)
2. Copy a Ticket ID (e.g. `DEMO0001`)
3. **Option 2** — Check Out Vehicle (paste the ticket ID)
4. See the fee breakdown

Data is saved to `smartpark.db`. Delete this file to reset demo data.

> **Note:** Check-out will crash until you implement `ParkingFeeCalculator`. This is expected — it's your first TDD task.

---

## 5. Run the API

```bash
dotnet run --project src/SmartPark.Api
```

The API starts on `http://localhost:5000`. Try the endpoints with `curl` or your browser.

> **Note:** Check-out will return 502 unless a payment service is running on port 9091. This is expected behavior when exploring the API locally.

---

## 6. Run Tests

```bash
dotnet test SmartPark.slnx                                    # all tests
dotnet test --filter "ParkingFeeCalculatorTests"              # unit tests
dotnet test --filter "ParkingSessionManagerTests"             # test doubles
dotnet test --filter "ParkingFlowIntegrationTests"            # integration
```

> **First run:** Some example tests will fail with `NotImplementedException` because `ParkingFeeCalculator` is not yet implemented. This is by design — your first TDD cycle starts here.

---

## 7. Code Coverage

```bash
dotnet test SmartPark.slnx --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

Coverage XML appears under `tests/SmartPark.Tests/TestResults/`. To get an HTML report:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool      # one time
reportgenerator \
  -reports:"tests/SmartPark.Tests/TestResults/*/coverage.cobertura.xml" \
  -targetdir:"coverage-report" \
  -reporttypes:Html
open coverage-report/index.html                               # macOS
```

## Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `dotnet` not found | Install .NET SDK and restart your terminal |
| Build fails — missing packages | Run `dotnet restore SmartPark.slnx` |
| No tests available | Normal until you add `[Fact]`/`[Theory]` methods |
| `NotImplementedException` on checkout | Implement `ParkingFeeCalculator` first (TDD Step 3) |
| Database locked | Close other instances of the console app |

---

| Run all tests | `dotnet test SmartPark.slnx` |
| Run specific tests | `dotnet test --filter "ClassName"` |
| Code coverage | `dotnet test SmartPark.slnx --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` |
| Reset demo data | Delete `smartpark.db` and re-run the app |
